	As an admin on Schul-Cloud
	I want to be able to administrate pupils, teachers and classes

	Background:

		Given admin arrives on the Schul-Cloud homepage

	Scenario Outline: Admin creates a pupil

		When admin logs in with email <adminsUsername> and password <adminsPassword>
		When admin accepts data protection
		When admin goes to administration
		When admin goes to students administration
		And an admin puts in <firstName> and <secondName> and <studentEmail> of the new pupil
		And the admin should see new pupil with email <studentEmail> among his pupils
		And admin manually submits a consent <studentEmail>
		And admin logs out
		Then new pupil <studentEmail> can log in with default password
		Then student with full age accepts student's data protection with password <newPasswordStudent>
